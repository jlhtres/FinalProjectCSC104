# UX Portfolio Site – Jerry L. Henderson III

Welcome to my personal UX Design portfolio website. This site showcases my skills, experience, and selected projects in a clean, responsive layout built using HTML and CSS.

## Project Structure

### HTML Pages

- `test629.html`  
  ➤ The homepage. Introduces who I am, my background in UX design, and includes a portrait image aligned to the right using Flexbox.

- `work2.html`  
  ➤ The "My Work" page. Showcases three projects:
  - A wireframe of a food app (`wireframefoodapp.jpg`)
  - A high-fidelity version of the app (`Foodapp.jpg`)
  - An interactive Figma prototype (`interactiveprototype.jpg`)

- `Resume.html`  
  ➤ Displays my résumé using an embedded PDF viewer (`Jerry Henderson 2024 Resume August.pdf`).

- `Contact.html`  
  ➤ A simple contact form for users to submit their name, email, and phone number. The form is centered using external CSS.

## Styling

- All visual styles are handled in one external file: `newstylesheet2.css`.
- The site uses a modern, mobile-friendly layout with a consistent dark blue header, light gradient background, and web-safe fonts (`Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif`).
- Responsive layout is managed with Flexbox and max-width containers.

##  Best Practices Followed

- Semantic HTML5 tags used throughout (`<nav>`, `<section>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`)
- No inline CSS; all styles are kept in the external stylesheet
- Mobile-responsive design with Flexbox and scaling images
- Clean and readable class naming

---

##  Getting Started

1. Place all `.html` files and images in the same folder.
2. Open `test629.html` in a browser to start navigating the site.
3. Make sure `newstylesheet2.css` is in the same folder and linked in each HTML page.
4. The résumé PDF should be placed alongside `Resume.html` to display correctly.
